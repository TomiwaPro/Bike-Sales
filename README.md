# Bike Sales Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insigts into the sales performance of a bike company over the past years, from 2011-2016. By analyzing various aspects of the sales dats, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain deeper understandingg of the company's performance.

### Data Source

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the 'sales.csv' file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company. I got the dataset from Kaggle, [Find Here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sadiqshah/bike-store-sales-in-europe/input?select=Sales.csv)

### Tools
- Excel - Data cleaning and transformation
- Excel - visualization

### Data Cleaning
Before I start cleaning the data I created another sheet named 'Working Sheet', this is where the data cleaning and transformation will take place and the reason for creating another sheet id to retail our raw dataset incase there is loss of data during data cleaning or others we can easily go data to our raw data without disturbing our client for the same dataset, it is more like a backup plan for the dataset.

- Removing Duplicate

To remove the duplicates in the data I use the 'Remove Duplicate' function which remove the duplicates. The initial number of rows we have is 113,037, after apply the function we now have 112,037 rows.

### Data Transformation

- Renaming column value

The customer Gender is 'M' and 'F', I'm going to rename them for ease understanding, 'M' as 'Male' and 'F' as 'Female'. This is achievable by the 'Replace All' function in Excel.

Now the data is ready for visualization, we have 18 columns and they are all in the right format.
